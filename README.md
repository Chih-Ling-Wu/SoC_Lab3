# SoC_Lab3

  In this lab, we implemented a FIR system in Verilog, using AXI-Lite interfaces for coefficients and Stream interfaces for data. We also collaborated with a BRAM module to handle data efficiently. The core focus of this lab is to master the control of handshake signals within these protocols and to create a well-designed data flow.
